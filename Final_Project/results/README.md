# Notes

- The results for Juan's data at time interval 1s and 2s don't include the SVM classifier, which takes a bit to finish.
An updated version of the files will be uploaded tomorrow morning. 
Anyway, usually the Random Forest classifier outperforms the SVM

- the `top_features_{}.json` files contain the features sorted in decreasing order of importance.
